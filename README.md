# SimpleUsageOfAsyncTask
This is a simple program for testing the AsyncTask library. In this program, an artificial API has been created using the mocky.io site for testing data retrieval. Finally, the JSON file is displayed in a TextView. This program also utilizes data binding.

InputStreamReader is a class in Java (and Kotlin, which is interoperable with Java) that serves as a bridge between byte streams and character streams. It is used to read bytes from an InputStream and decode them into characters using a specified character encoding.

Here's a brief explanation of how InputStreamReader works:

Input Stream (InputStream): This is a stream of raw bytes, typically representing binary data. Examples include reading from a file, a network connection, or an input stream obtained from another source.

Character Encoding: Bytes in a computer are just numbers, and how these numbers are interpreted to represent characters depends on a character encoding. A character encoding is a set of rules that assigns numerical values to characters.

InputStreamReader: This class wraps an InputStream and provides a way to read characters from it. It takes care of decoding the raw bytes into characters using a specified character encoding.
